Gondar,"Dubbed the ""Camelot of Africa,"" the city of Gondar was the capital of Ethiopia from 1636 until the mid-19th century. The city combines a modern feel with an architectural sensibility that harks back to the Middle Ages. Its physical and architectural centerpiece is Fasil Ghebbi, a walled Royal Compound containing a half-dozen fairytale castles, including the three-story original built by Emperor Fasil in the 1630s. The Fasil Ghebbi UNESCO World Heritage Site also incorporates several more remote constructions, most notably the Church of Debre Berhan Selassie, with its beautifully painted interior.,What to See,·,       ,Enclosed by tall stone walls, the central Fasil Ghebbi is a 7-hectare ""Royal Compound"" housing six fortified stone castles built from the 1630s onward. The most striking is Emperor Fasil's three-story castle, which stands 32 meters high and displays a blend of Portuguese, Indian, and indigenous Aksumite influences, typical of the Gondarine style.,·,       ,Consecrated in 1693 under Emperor Iyasu I, Debre Berhan Selassie (Mountain of the Enlightened Trinity) was the only major Gondarine church to survive the Mahdist attack of 1888 unscathed—thanks, legend has it, to the intervention of a virulent bee swarm. The ceiling, adorned with 17th-century paintings of 80 cherubic faces, is arguably the most famous ecclesiastic artwork in Ethiopia.,·,       ,The sunken Fasil's Pool, overlooked by a two-story building attributed to Emperor Fasil, is where Gondar's colorfully celebrated annual Timkat (Ethiopian Epiphany) celebrations take place on January 19 (a day later in leap years).,·,       ,Named after a Coptic convent in Egypt, the 18th-century Kuskuam Palace was constructed on the slopes of Debre Tsehay (Mountain of Sun) for the charismatic Empress Mentewab, wife of Emperor Bakaffa and regent to their son Iyasu II and grandson Iyaos I.,·,       ,On the northern outskirts of Gondar, an abandoned synagogue at Woleka evokes the story of Beta Israel, a ""lost tribe"" of Ethiopian Jews whose last 10,000-or-so adherents were airlifted to Israel during the 1980s.,·,       ,Old Gorgora, on the Lake Tana shore 65 km south of Gondar, houses the most remote of the sites that comprise the Fasil Ghebbi UNESCO World Heritage Site: a ruined castle and Catholic church called Maryam Gimb.,·,       ,The 14th-century Monastery of Debre Sina Maryam, a monastic church at ""new"" Gorgora, is decorated with some of Ethiopia's oldest surviving paintings, executed in the 1620s under the patronage of Melakotawit, the elder sister of Emperor Fasil.,Getting There,By Road: Gondar stands about 730 km north of Addis Ababa, 176 km north of Bahir Dar, and 355 km southwest of Aksum. The drive from Aksum takes you through the very scenic Simien Mountains National Park.,By Air: Daily flights connect Gondar to Addis Ababa, Lalibela, and Aksum (www.ethiopianairlines.com). The airport is about 17 km south of the town center, off the road to Bahir Dar. Most hotels offer a free airport transfer service, and taxis are also available.,Getting Around,Taxis are widely available and inexpensive in the town center. Several local operators offer day tours of the town and longer excursions to the Simien Mountains. When visiting Fasil Ghebbi, a knowledgeable local guide is optional but highly recommended. Guides can be obtained at the guides' association kiosk next to the ticket office.,Annual Events & Festivals,Gondar is renowned as the best place to be during Timkat, with its unique cultural performances. Timkat is the Ethiopian Orthodox equivalent of Epiphany, celebrated on January 19 (a day later in leap years). The festival culminates in a crowded and colorful afternoon reenactment of the first baptism, held at the 17th-century Fasil's Pool, which is filled with water for the occasion.",6,https://www.visitethiopia.et/uploads/0000/28/2025/07/07/gondar-2.jpg,https://www.visitethiopia.et/space/gondar-2,"https://www.visitethiopia.et/uploads/0000/28/2025/07/07/casaaspture1.png,https://www.visitethiopia.et/uploads/0000/28/2025/07/07/casaaspture2.png,https://www.visitethiopia.et/uploads/0000/28/2025/07/07/gondar-2.jpg,https://www.visitethiopia.et/uploads/0000/28/2025/07/07/gondar-1.jpg,https://www.visitethiopia.et/uploads/0000/28/2025/07/07/gondar-awet.jpg,https://www.visitethiopia.et/uploads/0000/28/2025/07/07/gondardg.jpg,https://www.visitethiopia.et/uploads/0000/28/2025/07/07/goner.jpg,https://www.visitethiopia.et/uploads/0000/28/2025/07/07/gondar-klh.jpg,https://www.visitethiopia.et/uploads/0000/28/2025/07/07/gondar-khlsdf.jpg","https://www.google.com/maps/place/7.370172817200326,36.05644478071459/@7.370172817200326,36.05644478071459,9z",

Debre Libanos,"The 13th-century monastery of Debre Libanos is located 130 km from the capital, Addis Ababa. A trip to this ancient monastery offers a myriad of experiences for travelers. Beyond its significant medieval Ethiopian history, the area is renowned for its stunning scenic views, abundant bird species, and excellent hiking opportunities. Nestled within a steep riverine canyon, the monastery has long been a center of monastic order and Ethiopian Orthodox Church education.
Founded by the Ethiopian St. Tekle Haymanot, the monastery is a repository of medieval Orthodox Church history. Over its long history, the monastery has faced many challenges, but the worst occurred in the first half of the 20th century. In 1937, the Italian army destroyed the original church and carried out a massacre that claimed the lives of 800 monks, deacons, and lay worshippers. The modern church, with its domed roof and stained-glass windows, remains an important pilgrimage site. The nearby Portuguese Bridge offers a chance to hike and enjoy the picturesque Jemma River valley. Although locals believe the stone-arch bridge was built by the Portuguese in the 16th century, it was actually constructed in the 1890s by Ras Darge in the old Portuguese style. The narrow span makes for a spectacular photo opportunity, and the gushing cascade just below it (in the rainy season) is very impressive.

What to See

·       The Monastery: Nestled beneath dramatic cliffs overlooking the Jemma River Gorge, Debre Libanos stands as a significant historical monastery in Ethiopia. Its current church, constructed by Emperor Haile Selassie in 1961, offers a tranquil space adorned with beautiful stained-glass windows.

·       Portuguese Bridge: Offering spectacular views, particularly when a waterfall plunges into the gorge below during the rainy season, this picturesque bridge is a favorite spot for photography and picnics. Constructed in a traditional Portuguese style, it crosses the gorge at its narrowest point near the monastery.

Getting There

It is East Africa’s most geologically active region and is made up of active volcanoes, salt lakes, and lava lakes. The Afar Triangle is considered to be one of the most important mantle plumes (or “hot spots”) of the Earth system. It straddles Ethiopia, Eritrea and Djibouti in the Horn of Africa. In terms of geology, Afar appears as a unique place on the planet.

Ruined palaces, obelisks, mausoleums, ruined churches, megalithic erected stones, coins, and manuscripts witness the golden period of the Aksumite Empire. The importance of the city is much elevated as it houses the most valuable and sacred relics of the tablet of Mosses or the arks of the covenant and as the place where one of the ‘Three Wise Men’ buried here.

What to See?

 
Established shortly after Aksum’s leaders converted to Christianity, the 4th-century Cathedral of Tsion Maryam (Mary of Zion) is Ethiopia’s oldest church. The original church, modeled on Solomon’s Temple in Jerusalem, fell victim to the warrior queen Gudit in the 10th century, but the foundations of one of the original 12 temples are still visible. A replacement church, built in the 17th-century Gondarine style by Emperor Fasilidas, has a beautifully painted interior.
Aksum’s Chapel of the Tablet is said to be where the Biblical Ark of the Covenant now resides. According to legend, this holiest of Old Testament artifacts was carried to Ethiopia by Emperor Menelik I – son of the Queen of Sheba and King Solomon of Jerusalem – some 3,000 years ago.
A pre-Christian Stelae Field opposite Maryam Tsion incorporates the tallest blocks of solid stone ever erected in ancient times. The largest of the giant stelae, a 33-meter tall granite megalith attributed to the 3rd-century King Remhai, toppled over and shattered whilst it was being erected. Alongside it, the two tallest standing stelae are both comparable in stature to a ten-storey building, standing 25 and 23 meters high.
The Aksum Archaeological Museum displays a wealth of ancient artifacts uncovered around Aksum, ranging from 3rd century Aksumite coins to glasses imported from Egypt.
Other sites of interest include May Shum (also known as the Queen of Sheba’s pool), the ruined Dongar Palace, a trilingual tablet inscribed in Sabaean, Ge’ez, and Greek by King Ezana, and the 6th-century tombs of Kaleb and Gebre Meskel.
 

Getting There 
Aksum lies 1024 km north of Addis Ababa via Mekele or 1180 km via Gondar.

Daily flights connect Askum to Gondar, Lalibela, and Addis Ababa (www.ethiopianairlines.com). The airport is about 5km east of the town center and most hotels offer a free transfer service.

Tours can be booked with local tour operators in Addis Ababa and the main towns.

Getting Around  

Taxis and bajaji (tuc-tucs) are readily available to visit all the tourist sites in and around town. Any hotel or tour operator can arrange more formal transport. Guides are optional but recommended and can be arranged at the Aksum Guides Association next to the ticket office for the central stelae field.

Annual Events & Festivals

Aksum is an excellent place to celebrate Meskel (27 September except on leap years), a unique Ethiopian Christian festival commemorating the finding of the True Cross. The main highlight of this colourful festival is the burning of a massive bonfire in front of the central stelae and the Cathedral of Maryam Tsion. Other popular festivals are Timkat (January 19 except on leap years) and the day of Kidus Maryam (Saint Mary) on 1 December.

Things to Do

Plenty of craft stalls running along the main road east of the central stelae field. This is a good place to buy traditional cotton cloths worn by the women of Tigrai, as well as baskets, crosses, and other traditional handicrafts.",34,https://www.visitethiopia.et/uploads/0000/28/2025/05/09/axum11.jpeg,https://www.visitethiopia.et/space/aksum,"https://www.visitethiopia.et/uploads/0000/28/2025/05/09/axum11.jpeg,https://www.visitethiopia.et/uploads/0000/28/2025/05/09/axum2.jpg","https://www.google.com/maps/place/9.0865,38.7624/@9.0865,38.7624,10z","https://www.google.com/maps/place/14.123047375496949,38.723673419025836/@14.123047375496949,38.723673419025836,8z"
Jimma,"The capital of a coffee-producing area, Jimma is a large, lively city blessed with excellent tourist facilities and a warm location in the fertile western highlands. The town is named after the 19th-century Islamic kingdom of Jimma, which lay at the meeting point of several trade routes. The last autonomous ruler of Jimma was King Abba Jiffar, whose impressive palace at Jiren, on the outskirts of the modern city, has been restored with partial funding from UNESCO. Other attractions include the daily central market, the ethnographic displays at the Jimma Museum, a nearby patch of forest inhabited by the spectacular colobus monkey, and out-of-town Lake Boye with its resident hippos.

What to See

The historic city of Jimma offers myriad products for visitors. The historical Jimma Aba Jifar palace which perched on a staggering mesa is an ideal cultural stopover in the city. Constructed with an amazing mix of wooden and masonry structures, the compound keeps an age-old mosque, palace, and living quarters. Check the nearby museum for the superb collections! The Jimma museum in the center of the city is also one of the places of interest in the city.

Getting There

Jimma is best accessed from Addis Ababa by car with asphalt road (325 km from Addis Ababa). Ethiopian Airlines has also a daily scheduled flight to Jimma.

Danakil Depression,"Explore the Danakil from either the Tigraian capital Mekele (760km north of Addis Ababa by road), or the Afar capital Semera (590km from Addis Ababa). Both are connected to Addis Ababa by daily flights (,).,The Danakil is a genuine expedition destination. Although a good 350km road now runs from Semera to Mekele via Afdera, the tracks to Dallol and Do Dom (for Erta Ale) require 4×4 and navigational skills. The region is best visited with an experienced operator using a minimum of two 4x4s, and experienced staff who know the local Afar. Helicopter access is from Mekele.,Most organized tours start in Addis Ababa. Operators also offer tours directly out of Semera and Mekele. The minimum time required for a full tour is two nights, spending one at Hamed Ela and one on the rim of Erta Ale. An extra night at Erta Ale is recommended if you want to see the crater by day, and another for Lake Afdera.,Most sites in the region can be accessed by 4×4 only. To get to Erta Ale, you must hike 10km along gently ascending slopes to the crater rim. There is no shade, and daytime temperatures tend to be searingly hot, so ascend at dusk and return early the next morning., ",36,https://www.visitethiopia.et/uploads/0000/57/2025/01/03/original-unsmushed.jpg,https://www.visitethiopia.et/space/danakil-depression,"https://www.visitethiopia.et/uploads/0000/1/2025/07/08/image94.jpg,https://www.visitethiopia.et/uploads/0000/1/2025/07/08/image74.jpg,https://www.visitethiopia.et/uploads/0000/1/2025/07/08/image84.jpg,https://www.visitethiopia.et/uploads/0000/1/2025/07/08/image64.jpg,https://www.visitethiopia.et/uploads/0000/1/2025/07/08/image114.jpg,https://www.visitethiopia.et/uploads/0000/1/2025/07/08/image24.jpg,https://www.visitethiopia.et/uploads/0000/1/2025/07/08/image44.jpg,https://www.visitethiopia.et/uploads/0000/1/2025/07/08/image34.jpg,https://www.visitethiopia.et/uploads/0000/1/2025/07/08/image54.jpg,https://www.visitethiopia.et/uploads/0000/57/2025/01/03/the-danakil.jpg,https://www.visitethiopia.et/uploads/0000/57/2025/01/03/original-unsmushed.jpg",null,
Babile Elephant Sanctuary,"Extending over almost 7,000 square kilometers to the southeast of Harar, Babile Elephant Sanctuary is a vast and spectacular reserve comprising wide gorges flanked by open plains, rocky outcrops, meandering river beds, and, in the south and the east, a drier almost-desert like landscape. Babile is home to Africa’s most north-easterly population of elephants, which some authorities assign to a unique race Loxodonta africana orleansi, endemic to the Horn of Africa. The sanctuary also provides refuge to thin populations of the localized black-maned Abyssinian lion and greyhound-like cheetah, along with various antelope (including greater and lesser kudu), the hamadryas baboon, and a spectacular selection of dry-country birds, including the endemic Salvadori’s serin. An estimated 200 elephants inhabit Babile, moving seasonally between the Erer and Gobelle river valleys, but also sometimes venturing outside the sanctuary to the western ridge of the Gobelle Valley. The best time of year to visit is the late rainy season (June to September) when the elephants usually congregate in the Upper Erer Valley about 40km from Harar.

What to See 

This is one of the best spots in Ethiopia to watch the endangered black elephant.

Getting There 

Babile which is found 580 km from the capital Addis Ababa can be accessed with a surface drive. Ethiopian Airlines has also a daily flight to Diredawa and Jigjiga.

Getting Around

Bale Mountains National Park,"Ethiopia’s most important biodiversity hotspot, Bale Mountains National Park supports a rich mosaic of high-altitude habitats including lush evergreen forest, stands of giant bamboo, pastel-shaded moorland, and sheltered river valleys swathed in fragrant juniper-hagenia woodland. Inscribed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 2023, the park is the most important stronghold to three endemic large mammal species – the charismatic Ethiopian wolf, handsome mountain nyala, and delightful Bale monkey – while its incredible avifauna is reflected by the African Birding Club having listed it as one of the continent’s top five birding hotspots.,Bale’s high-altitude centerpiece is the Sanetti Plateau, a vast lava plateau interspersed with several 4,200-plus meter volcanic cones. Sanetti is the world’s most extensive Afro-Alpine moorland, comprising tussocks of heather interspersed with icy tarns and ethereal giant lobelias. The northern slopes below Sanetti support a mix of juniper-hagenia woodland and Afromontane grassland, while the southern slopes are layered with altitudinal bands of Erica, bamboo, and Afromontane forest.,Bale’s 1,300-plus plant species include 160 Ethiopian endemics and 23 unique to the park.,Bale is the main global stronghold for the endangered Ethiopian wolf, a handsome red-and-white canid often seen trotting through the heather of the Sanetti Plateau, where it feeds on rodents such as the endemic giant mole-rat.,Bale is the last main stronghold for the endangered mountain nyala, a large spiral-horned antelope most often seen on the short walking trail that runs through the juniper-hagenia forest around the park headquarters at Dinsho. Other mammals often encountered at Dinsho include warthog, Bohor reedbuck, and Menelik’s bushbuck.,The Harenna Forest south of Sanetti supports the park’s richest variety of large mammals, These include the remarkable giant forest hog (the world’s largest swine) and the very localized Bale monkey, a vulnerable endemic whose tiny range is attributable to its specialized diet of bamboo.,Bale stands out as the best place in Ethiopia to see endemic birds. Six national endemics are present, alongside another 11 species shared only with Eritrea, and several others unique to the Horn of Africa. Juniper-hagenia forest around Dinsho hosts woodland species such as white-cheeked turaco, yellow-fronted parrot, black-winged lovebird, and Abyssinian catbird, while high-altitude specialties on Sanetti include Rouget’s rail, chestnut-naped francolin, Spot-breasted plover, and alpine chat.,Bale supports the only known sub-Saharan breeding populations of a golden eagle, ruddy shelduck, and red-billed chough, underscoring the Palaearctic affiliations of Ethiopia’s wildlife.,Bale is surprisingly easy to explore by vehicle, with all-weather roads offering access to most of its more alluring habitats – indeed all-weather road across the Sanetti Plateau to the 4,377m peak of Mount Tulu Dimtu, the second highest point in Africa.,Dinsho, the park headquarters, is 370km from Addis Ababa via Adama and Asela, the quickest and least trafficked road route. An alternative 420km route via Shashemene is preferred by tours that also include the Rift Valley lakes. Tours can be booked with local tour operators in the main towns.,An all-weather road runs from Dinsho via Robe to Goba before continuing south to traverse the Sanetti Plateau and then descend into the Harenna Forest. This road offers good wildlife viewing and birding and comes with a good chance of spotting many endemics, but the likes of Dinsho and the Harenna Forest will be more productive explored on foot. Multi-day hikes can be organized at the guides association and ticketing office at Dinsho.,Things to Do ,Bale is a superb destination for hiking and mule-back treks. A good starting point for walkers is the undemanding trail around Dinsho, or the half-day Bamboo and Waterfall Trail in the Harenna Forest. Longer trails out of Dinsho, mostly above the 3,000m contour, take from two to eleven days.",38,https://www.visitethiopia.et/uploads/0000/57/2025/01/03/bale-mountains-giant-erica-harenna-forest-1-unsmushed.jpg,https://www.visitethiopia.et/space/bale-mountains-national-park,"https://www.visitethiopia.et/uploads/0000/28/2025/07/08/wolfbalegroup10-14-8.jpg,https://www.visitethiopia.et/uploads/0000/28/2025/07/08/mvmimg-6587.jpg,https://www.visitethiopia.et/uploads/0000/28/2025/07/08/gettyimages-1498937454-612x612.jpg,https://www.visitethiopia.et/uploads/0000/28/2025/07/08/gettyimages-996934388-612x612.jpg,https://www.visitethiopia.et/uploads/0000/28/2025/07/08/gettyimages-174137549-612x612.jpg,https://www.visitethiopia.et/uploads/0000/28/2025/07/08/gettyimages-1355984721-612x612.jpg,https://www.visitethiopia.et/uploads/0000/28/2025/07/08/gettyimages-1149422523-612x612.jpg,https://www.visitethiopia.et/uploads/0000/28/2025/07/08/gettyimages-139826080-612x612.jpg,https://www.visitethiopia.et/uploads/0000/28/2025/07/08/gettyimages-139825011-612x612.jpg,https://www.visitethiopia.et/uploads/0000/57/2025/01/03/bale-mountains-giant-erica-harenna-forest-1-unsmushed.jpg,https://www.visitethiopia.et/uploads/0000/57/2025/01/03/the-bale-mountains-1.jpg,https://www.visitethiopia.et/uploads/0000/57/2025/01/03/bale-mountains-trekking-and-hiking.jpg",null,

Lower Valley of the Awash,"Hadar is one of the iconic places of Ethiopia with paleontological discoveries. The Hadarpaleontological discoveries include partial skeletons of Australopithecus afarensis, a key species in human evolution. Major paleontological work began at Hadar in the early 1970s and was led by the American anthropologist Donald Johanson. His team discovered a 40-percent-complete female skeleton of Australopithecus afarensis that became popularly known as Lucy. Dated to 3.2 million years ago, the remains provided further evidence that, in human evolution, walking on two legs (bipedalism) preceded increased brain size. The pelvis and leg bones indicate upright posture, but the skull bones reveal a limited cranial capacity similar to that of modern chimpanzees. The Australopithecus afarensis-bearing levels at Hadar range from 3.4 to 2.9 million years old and include more than 200 fossils from a single site (Afar Locality 333), representing at least nine adults and four juveniles deposited at the same time. The site has also yielded the earliest known remains of the human genus, Homo, which dates to 2.3 million years ago, along with some of the earliest known evidence of tool use.

What to See 

People come here to witness where the amazing fossil of Lucy and other important hominid skeletons discovered. Apart from its invaluable potential for paleontological discoveries, the geographical feature of the area is appealing and eye-catching. The Awash river bed in the vicinity of the Hadar paleontological site keeps important biodiversity.

Getting There 

Hadar can be accessed both by flight and surface drive. Ethiopian Airlines has a scheduled flight to the regional capital Samara. From Samara you can drive southward towards Kombolcha. En route there is a small town called Eli wuha which is the turning junction to the paleontological site of Hadar. Visitors also can reach Hadar both from Addis Ababa and the Danakil depression. If you are coming from Addis Ababa, Addis Ababa- kombolcha route (370 km ) is the better option.

Getting Around

Local guides and community leaders will take you around on the paleontological sites and the Awash river bed. walking is the only way to get around in Hadar.

Accommodation 

If you need to spend a night in Hadar you need to bring camping materials, camp organizers, and your own food. But if you decide to spend a night in Samara or Kombolcha there are standard lodging facilities to stay in.

Gondar,"Dubbed the ""Camelot of Africa,"" the city of Gondar was the capital of Ethiopia from 1636 until the mid-19th century. The city combines a modern feel with an architectural sensibility that harks back to the Middle Ages. Its physical and architectural centerpiece is Fasil Ghebbi, a walled Royal Compound containing a half-dozen fairytale castles, including the three-story original built by Emperor Fasil in the 1630s. The Fasil Ghebbi UNESCO World Heritage Site also incorporates several more remote constructions, most notably the Church of Debre Berhan Selassie, with its beautifully painted interior.,What to See,·,       ,Enclosed by tall stone walls, the central Fasil Ghebbi is a 7-hectare ""Royal Compound"" housing six fortified stone castles built from the 1630s onward. The most striking is Emperor Fasil's three-story castle, which stands 32 meters high and displays a blend of Portuguese, Indian, and indigenous Aksumite influences, typical of the Gondarine style.,·,       ,Consecrated in 1693 under Emperor Iyasu I, Debre Berhan Selassie (Mountain of the Enlightened Trinity) was the only major Gondarine church to survive the Mahdist attack of 1888 unscathed—thanks, legend has it, to the intervention of a virulent bee swarm. The ceiling, adorned with 17th-century paintings of 80 cherubic faces, is arguably the most famous ecclesiastic artwork in Ethiopia.,·,       ,The sunken Fasil's Pool, overlooked by a two-story building attributed to Emperor Fasil, is where Gondar's colorfully celebrated annual Timkat (Ethiopian Epiphany) celebrations take place on January 19 (a day later in leap years).,·,       ,Named after a Coptic convent in Egypt, the 18th-century Kuskuam Palace was constructed on the slopes of Debre Tsehay (Mountain of Sun) for the charismatic Empress Mentewab, wife of Emperor Bakaffa and regent to their son Iyasu II and grandson Iyaos I.,·,       ,On the northern outskirts of Gondar, an abandoned synagogue at Woleka evokes the story of Beta Israel, a ""lost tribe"" of Ethiopian Jews whose last 10,000-or-so adherents were airlifted to Israel during the 1980s.,·,       ,Old Gorgora, on the Lake Tana shore 65 km south of Gondar, houses the most remote of the sites that comprise the Fasil Ghebbi UNESCO World Heritage Site: a ruined castle and Catholic church called Maryam Gimb.,·,       ,The 14th-century Monastery of Debre Sina Maryam, a monastic church at ""new"" Gorgora, is decorated with some of Ethiopia's oldest surviving paintings, executed in the 1620s under the patronage of Melakotawit, the elder sister of Emperor Fasil.,Getting There,By Road: Gondar stands about 730 km north of Addis Ababa, 176 km north of Bahir Dar, and 355 km southwest of Aksum. The drive from Aksum takes you through the very scenic Simien Mountains National Park.,By Air: Daily flights connect Gondar to Addis Ababa, Lalibela, and Aksum (www.ethiopianairlines.com). The airport is about 17 km south of the town center, off the road to Bahir Dar. Most hotels offer a free airport transfer service, and taxis are also available.,Getting Around,Taxis are widely available and inexpensive in the town center. Several local operators offer day tours of the town and longer excursions to the Simien Mountains. When visiting Fasil Ghebbi, a knowledgeable local guide is optional but highly recommended. Guides can be obtained at the guides' association kiosk next to the ticket office.,Annual Events & Festivals,Gondar is renowned as the best place to be during Timkat, with its unique cultural performances. Timkat is the Ethiopian Orthodox equivalent of Epiphany, celebrated on January 19 (a day later in leap years). The festival culminates in a crowded and colorful afternoon reenactment of the first baptism, held at the 17th-century Fasil's Pool, which is filled with water for the occasion.",65,https://www.visitethiopia.et/uploads/0000/28/2025/05/09/gondar-2.jpg,https://www.visitethiopia.et/space/gondar-1,null,null,
